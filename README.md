# 🧠 Barcode & Code Decoding Project

This project is a collection of decoding scripts I built after learning how different types of barcodes and data codes work.

After exploring **Aztec**, **MaxiCode**, **QR Code**, **Bar Code**, **PDF417**, and **Data Matrix**, I created scripts that can **detect and decode** these codes using libraries like `zxing` and `opencv-python`.

## 📦 Supported Codes
- 🌀 **Aztec Code**
- 🔺 **MaxiCode**
- 🧾 **PDF417**
- 🧩 **Data Matrix**
- 🔳 **QR Code**
- 📊 **1D Barcodes**

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **ZXing**
- **Pyzbar**

## 🚀 What I Learned
After learning how each of these codes works, I can now **analyze, detect, and decode** them programmatically.  
This project really helped me understand the **structure of visual data encoding** and how different formats store information.
